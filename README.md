# GRBPreconMap
Recovering Gamma-Ray Burst Redshift Completeness Maps via Spherical Generalized Additive Models

We use a comprehensive database of the Swift GRBs with measured positions and spectroscopic redshifts.  Here we use the Swift XRT enhanced positional information, if available for a given event, otherwise we use the Swift BAT position.

The selection results in a total of 1665 GRBs in the blue.csv file.  Of this sample, 427 GRBs possess precise spectroscopic redshifts, with 300 derived from afterglow observations (bluea.csv) and 127 from host galaxy measurements (blueh.csv).

In the hpixlb5.csv there are 12288 HEALPix grid positions.
